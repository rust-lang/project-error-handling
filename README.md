## How do I follow the project group's work?

The best place to start is probably the agenda of the next meeting. This is
where we track action items from the previous meeting, the previous meetings
agenda and minutes, and upcoming topics for the next meeting. You can also check
out our issue tracker, project boards, and zulip chat to see all of the pieces
of work that we're doing.
