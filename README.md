## How do I follow the project group's work?

The best place to start is probably the agenda of the next meeting. This is
where we track action items from the previous meeting, the previous
meetings's agenda and minutes, and upcoming topics for the next meeting. You
can also check out our issue tracker, project boards, and zulip chat to see
the various pieces of what we're working on.

## How Can I Get Involved?

Participation in this project group is open to all. You can see our work in
progress via our [open issues] on this repository and you can participate in
discussions via our [Zulip stream][chat-link]. We primarily coordinate via
our meetings, which are tracked [here][meeting-schedule]. If you're
interested in attending our meetings but can't due to a schedule conflist
please let us know on the [scheduling issue] so we can best accommodate everyone.
