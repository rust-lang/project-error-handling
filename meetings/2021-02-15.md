# Meeting Minutes

- Reviewing open action items:
    - "Follow up on the 'Fix the Error trait' issue" is still unassigned: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/53487
        - Main thing that needs to happen is to remove the out of date items about the formatting repr for Backtrace.
        - Assigned to DPC
    - Regular meeting time was setup to work on the _Rust Error Book_.
    - Followed up with Charles explaining `Sized` and `assert2`
    - "Plan out changes needed to get `panic_error` added to std/core" assigned to Jane.

- Action Items from the Previous Week
    - [x] Hack session to work on the _Rust Error Book_.
    - [ ] Follow up on `rust-sv` regression that was introduced with the `impl Error for &E: Error` change.
    - [ ] Follow up with infra team to get readership statistics on how many people read the blog post: https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2020/11/23/What-the-error-handling-project-group-is-working-on.html.
    - Jane made progress on the "Backtrace in core" impl and is hoping to test it and start mass producing ICEs.
    - oliver and Jane made good progress on "Dig deeper into the Backtrace in core PR": https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/77384
    - Jakub dug through and did some thinking on the "Termination trait polishing" issue: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/43301#issuecomment-761900006
        - May need to wait until the `Try` trait v2 RFC is further along since it may impact the design or impl of the Termination trait.
        - Once generic member access is added, we can have the Termination impl alway check the `&dyn Error` type for an `ExitCode` to be used as the exit code when terminating.
        - Ideally we'll want to see if we can minimize the dependency between Termination and the `ExitCode` so that Termination "just works" regardless of what extra functionality gets added to `ExitCode` down the line.

- New Action Items Added
    - Schedule recurring meeting for book impl / study session [Jane]
    - Update API guidelines to add a section on implementing Display vs source: [unassigned]
    - Create an issue detailing plan for specializing unwrap / expect for E: Error [Jane]
    - Create an issue tracking the desire for an aborting interface for panics [unassigned]
    - Create an issue for a non allocating interface for printing a Backtrace [unassigned]
    - Create a diagram mapping out the pieces of error handling and how they relate for the book (e.g. Result, panic, Try, Error, etc) [unassigned]

- Recurring _Rust Error Book_ session tentatively scheduled for 11 PST on Thursdays.
- Add https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/80851 and https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3058 to the list of PRs the group is watching.
