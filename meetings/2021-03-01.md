# Meeting Minutes

## Reviewing Action Items
 - Jane to start doing some pre-meeting triage of the action items list
 - Got the recurring book meeting setup
 - Stage the API guidelines changes and have them go live after Jane's blog post is done
 - Charles making progress on the Error Book diagram
 - Jakub making progress on the termination trait issue
 - Sean made no progress on adding `panic_error` to std/core
     - Jane to take this one since it's closely related to the blog post she's working on
     - Jane will be taking on all action items that involve creating issues

## Status Updates
- Jane is approximately 75% done with the blog post
    - Updated plan is now:
        - 1. move error trait to core
        - 2. add `panic_error` function like `panic_any`
        - 3. specialize `unwrap` and `expect` to use `panic_error`
        - 4. add a reporting mechanism to either the error trait or to the `fmt` grammar for printing errors as a report including source error messages
        - 5. Introduce a `Box<dyn Error>` equivalent that implement's Error and not `From<E: Error>`
        - 6. Add an alternative Result type that uses `FromResidual` to convert error types during `?`
        - 7. Add lints to discourage usage of `Box<dyn Error>`
- Charles is working on the Error Book diagram
- Jakub is working on the termination trait issue
- Sean is working on writing the content around the `minigrep` project example for the Error Book

## Reviewing Open Issues

- Currently sitting on [https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3084](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3084); waiting for more feedback from the Rust community before we decide how to move forward with it
